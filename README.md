# Arrive-SG

## Problem Statement
How can we help Singapore immigrants or returning citizens overcome their challenges of transitioning to life in Singapore?

 
## Motivation 
With Singapore being a global country yet having a small population, the need to tap on skilled labour from other countries has been ever so important. Immigrants from all walks of life are also interested to live in Singapore. One of them is our friend, Alex, who came to Singapore to study at Nanyang Technological University. However, Alex has not been through a particularly easy onboarding process. This might be due to either lack of information or hassle within applications for financial services. In addition, he was also disappointed that he was not able to link up with locals/foreigners who have the same interests or background due to the lack of opportunities afforded to international students at the University level. This has been made worse by COVID-19. As such, a mobile application that can help international citizens connect with like-minded individuals in Singapore can help them settle in more quickly.
